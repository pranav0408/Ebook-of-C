C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.

	Sr.No.	Loop Type & Description
	1	while loop
		Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. 
		It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

	2	for loop
		Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code 
		that manages the loop variable.

	3	do...while loop
		It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at 
		the end of the loop body.

	4	nested loops
		You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.

Loop Control Statements
		
		Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution 
		leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

C supports the following control statements.

		Sr.No.	Control Statement & Description
		1	break statement
			Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to 
			the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

		2	continue statement
			Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest 
			its condition prior to reiterating.

		3	goto statement
			Transfers control to the labeled statement.
