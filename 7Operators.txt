	An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or 
	logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following 
	types of operators -

	->Arithmetic Operators
	->Relational Operators
	->Logical Operators
	->Bitwise Operators
	->Assignment Operators
	->Misc Operators

Operators Precedence in C
	
	Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how 
	an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, 
	the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
