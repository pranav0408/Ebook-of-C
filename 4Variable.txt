	A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our 
	programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, 
	which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; 
	the range of values that can be stored within that memory; 
	and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

	The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the 
	underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. 
	Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. 
	Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there 
	will be the following basic variable types -

	Sr.No.	Type & Description
	1	char

	Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an integer type.

	2	int

	The most natural size of integer for the machine.

	3	float

	A single-precision floating point value.

	4	double

	A double-precision floating point value.

	5	void

	Represents the absence of type.
