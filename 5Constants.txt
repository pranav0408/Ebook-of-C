	Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter 
	during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.

	Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer 
	constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. 
	There are enumeration constants as well.

	Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their 
	values cannot be modified after their definition.

Integer Literals
	An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. 
	A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 
	0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.

	An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, 
	for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or 
	lowercase and can be in any order.

Floating-point Literals
	A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional 
	part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals 
	either in decimal form or exponential form.

	While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, 
	the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must 
	include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent 
	is introduced by e or E.

String Literals
	String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". 
	A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain 
	characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.

	You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and 
	separating them using white spaces.
