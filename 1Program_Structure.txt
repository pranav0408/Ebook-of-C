Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look 
at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.

	Hello World Example
	A C program basically consists of the following parts -

	->Preprocessor Commands
	->Functions
	->Variables
	->Statements & Expressions
	->Comments

	Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World" -

 
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
     /* my first program in C */
    printf("Hello, World! \n");
   
    return 0;
  }
