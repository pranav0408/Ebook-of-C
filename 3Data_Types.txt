		Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or 
		functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space 
		it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.

		The types in C can be classified as follows -

Sr.No.	Types & Description
1	Basic Types

	They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer 
	types and (b) floating-point types.

2	Enumerated types

	They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables 
	that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.

3	The type void

	The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.

4	Derived types

	They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, 
	(d) Union types and (e) Function types.

	The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate 
	types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. 
	We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be 
	covered in the upcoming chapters.
